# Python-Login-and-Verification-App-with-Email-Authentication

This is a simple login application with verification functionality built using Tkinter. Users can enter their email and password, and upon successful login, a verification code is generated and sent via email. The user is then prompted to enter the verification code for authentication.

Note: This code provides a basic demonstration of a login and verification process. For real-world applications, additional security measures and validation mechanisms should be implemented.
